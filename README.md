# Specification for integrating CFRG algorithms in Java/JCE
This specification proposal is based on the following IETF RFCs and Drafts:
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-curdle-pkix-04
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cose-msg-24
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8037

The core issue is if CFRG algorithms should reuse the current EC classes or not.  *This specification is based
on the idea that the CFRG algorithms differ too much from EC to be conveniently
and logically mapped into the current EC classes and interfaces.*

As an example CFRG algorithms do not feature `ECPoint`, `coFactor`, or `ECField`.  Furthermore, the PKIX draft does not reuse the
ASN.1 definitions for EC either.

The remaining question would then be what to call this new key type.
Since both RFC 8037 and the COSE draft use the name "OKP" (Octet Key Pair), it seems reasonable adopting this name here as well.

Below is a very condensed version of the propoposal:

```java
public interface OPKKey {
   public String getCurve();         // Algorithm | RFC 8037 "crv"
   public boolean isSignatureKey();  // According to specs a key is either Signature or DH
}
```

```java
public interface OKPPublicKey extends PublicKey, OKPKey {
   public byte[] getX();  // Public key value | RFC 8037 "x"
}
```

```java
public interface OKPPrivateKey extends PrivateKey, OKPKey {
  public byte[] getD();  // Private key value | RFC 8037 "d"
}
```
Note: Software based private keys **must** support an *optional shadow link* to the associated public key
in order to maintain correct PKCS 8 data during serialization and deserialization.
Software based private keys created by `KeyPairGenerator` **should** provide
this link and thus produce PKCS 8 data *including* public key information for `getEncoded()`.
Private keys created by `OKPPrivateKeySpec` **should not** define this link and thus
produce PKCS 8 data *without* public key information for `getEncoded()`.

This is surely not an ideal solution but the Java world never standardized this part and now it is too late :-)

```java
String curve;  // Algorithm name
byte[] x;      // Public key value
byte[] d;      // Private key value
```

```java
KeyFactory.getInstance("OKP").generatePrivate(new OKPPrivateKeySpec(d, curve));
```

```java
KeyFactory.getInstance("OKP").generatePublic(new OKPPublicKeySpec(x, curve));
```

```java
AlgorithmParameterSpec keySpec = new OKPGenParameterSpec(curve);
KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("OKP");
kpg.initialize(keySpec);
```

```java
PKCS8EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(pkcs8PrivateKeyBlob);
KeyFactory.getInstance("OKP").generatePrivate(keySpec);
```

```java
Signature signature = Signature.getInstance("EdDSA");
```

The only place where it sort of breaks down is KeyAgreement, I would play it safe by inventing new name:
`KeyAgreement.getInstance("MoDH")` 
to not run into possible conflicts (_crashes_) with existing code and providers.  The additional test required to cope with "ECDH" and "MoDH" (for _Montgomery_ in analogy with _Edwards_) seems bearable:
```java
KeyAgreement.getInstance(publicKey instanceof ECKey ? "ECDH" : "MoDH");
```

 The key algorithm/curve identifiers needed are:
  ```
 id-X25519    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 110 }
 id-X448      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 111 }
 id-Ed25519   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 112 }
 id-Ed448     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 113 }
```
_It would IMO be a pity if Oracle, Bouncycastle, and Google(Android) took different routes for CFRG support._
