# Specification for integrating CFRG algorithms in Java/JCE
This specification proposal is based on the following IETF RFCs and Drafts:
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-curdle-pkix-04
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cose-msg-24
- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8037

The core issue is if CFRG algorithms should reuse the current EC classes.  This specification is based
on the the idea that the CFRG algoritms are too different from EC to be conveniently
and locally retrofitted into the EC classes and interfaces.

As an example CFRG algorithms do not feature `ECPoint`, `coFactor`, or `ECField`.  Futhermore, the PKIX draft does not reuse the
ASN.1 definitions for EC either., dIf distinct classes and interfaces are considered, "OKP" from RFC 8037 would be most logical.  Examples:
`OKPKey`, `OKPPublicKey`, and `OKPPrivateKey`

```
public interface OPKKey {
   public String getCurve();          // RFC 8037 "crv"
   public byte[] getX();              // RFC 8037 "x"
   public boolean isSignatureKey();   // According to specs a key is either Signature or DH
}
```

`KeyFactory.getInstance("OKP").generatePrivate(new OKPPrivateKeySpec(dValue, xValue, curveName))`

`KeyFactory.getInstance("OKP").generatePublic(new OKPPublicKeySpec(xValue, curveName))`

`AlgorithmParameterSpec spec =  new OKPGenParameterSpec(curveName)`
`KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("OKP")`

`Signature signature = Signature.getInstance("EdDSA")`

The only place where it sort of breaks down is KeyAgreement, I would play it safe by inventing new name:
`KeyAgreement.getInstance("MoDH")` 
to not run into possible conflicts (_crashes_) with existing code and providers.  The additional test required to cope with "ECDH" and "MoDH" (for _Montgomery_ in analogy with _Edwards_) seems bearable:
`KeyAgreement.getInstance(publicKey instanceof ECKey ? "ECDH" : "MoDH")`

 The named curve identifiers needed seem to be:
  ```
 id-X25519    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 110 }
 id-X448      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 111 }
 id-Ed25519   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 112 }
 id-Ed448     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 113 }
```
_Although maybe not a prime consideration for Bouncycastle, it would IMO be a pity if Oracle took another route for CFRG support._

The COSE draft also refers to "OKP": https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-cose-msg-24.
